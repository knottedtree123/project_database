shortdescription: "Replace JAX with custom autodiff in Awkward Array"
description: >
  At an [Analysis Tools](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1387764/)
  meeting and in
  [awkward#3349](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/discussions/3349),
  we've discussed the possibility of switching from JAX to a custom
  implementation to implement automatic differentiation (autodiff,
  also known as autograd). The problems with JAX are related to its
  interface, which is intended to do much more than just
  autodiff. Also, implementing eager autodiff is likely not a major
  project, especially if we take advantage of [complex-step
  differentiation](https://www.hedonisticlearning.com/posts/complex-step-differentiation.html). This
  project would either implement autodiff as a module within Awkward
  Array or as a new Scikit-HEP library (and possibly as a backend for
  Vector, too).
